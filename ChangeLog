20110628 CVS commit smbolton (0.6.9.0)

* MIDI non-registered parameters (NRPNs) can now be used to change
    any of the operator parameters for a plugin instance's current
    patch on-the-fly. Thanks to Jamie Bullock for contributing this
    code.

* It is now possible to ./configure hexter to build the GTK+ user
    interface, the text-mode UI, both, or neither (again, thanks to
    Jamie).

* The GTK+ GUI now requires GTK+ 2.4 or later.

* hexter may now be built to use floating-point math in its audio
    rendering. There is a new '--enable-floating-point' ./configure
    option, and a simple test harness in the fptest/ directory.

* Both the hexter GUI and tx_edit include even more patch loading
    enhancements from Martin Tarenskeen.

* The synthesis code has been simplified, so the once-separate car()
    and mod() functions are now just a single op(), which means less
    cache pressure for both code and data.

* There should be some other minor speed-ups as well: removed a
    bunch of slow unsigned to float casts, and fixed some constant
    expressions that were not being optimized.

* Oops. GUI 'sample-rate' method broke 'quit'.

* GUI no longer segfaults if started with no arguments.

20090103 version 0.6.2

* Silently ignore 'sample-rate' method.

* Fixed GtkSpinButton adjustments to avoid page_size warning with
    GTK+ >=2.14.

* Added Martin Tarenskeen's patch loading enhancements to
    extra/tx_edit.c.

20070411 version 0.6.1

* hexter now installs as DSSI plugin 'hexter', just like the 0.5.9
    and earlier versions, eliminating the trouble the versioned
    plugin names would cause distribution packagers.  The plugin
    files installed are again:
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter/hexter_gtk
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter.so
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter.la

    Also, there is now a 'disable LFO/Mod/Perf (0.5.x compatibility)'
    option in the hexter GUI which disables the version 0.6.x LFO,
    amplitude and pitch modulation functions, allowing projects made
    with version 0.5.9 to sound as they were originally created.

20070118 version 0.6.0

* hexter version 0.6.0 installed as DSSI plugin 'hexter6', with the
    following files:
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter6/hexter6_gtk
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter6.so
        <prefix>/lib/dssi/hexter6.la
    This allowed hexter 0.5.9 to be installed alongside the 0.6.0
    version, but was a headache for distribution packagers, so this
    was abandoned with version 0.6.1.

* Implemented the LFO, amplitude modulation and pitch modulation
    (many thanks to Jamie Bullock!)

* Added TX7-style performance parameters, allowing configuration
    from the GUI of pitch bend range, portamento time, and
    sensitivity and assignment of the modulation wheel, foot
    controller, pressure (both channel and key), and breath
    controller.

* Added DX7 patchbank loading code from Martin Tarenskeen, allowing
    hexter to load a number of additional patch file formats.

* Partially implemented portamento.  For now, the curves and times
    are wrong, but the plumbing is there.

20060108 version 0.5.9

* Added GUI '-test' magic host URL argument for starting GUI without
    a host.

* Improved the 'About' dialog with a new color pixmap.

* Fixed the held key tracking.

* Use gcc/glibc 'constructor' and 'destructor' attributes instead of
    the deprecated _init() and _fini() functions (needed for OS X
    10.4 'Tiger').

20051024 CVS commit smbolton

* Added support for change operator coarse frequency in real time
    via MIDI binding (for the Harvey Project).

* Minor gcc4 fixes.

20050411 CVS commit smbolton

* Initial Mac OS X support (sys-ex patch edit reception is still
    ALSA-only.)

20050119 CVS commit smbolton

( version bump to 0.5.9 )

* gcc 2.9x '-finline-limit=5000' fix in configure.in

* RPM bindir fix in src/Makefile.am

20041229 version 0.5.8

* Added a 'Volume' control, and implemented MIDI CC 7 'Volume'
    handling.

* Compiles with GTK+ 2.x by default, or with GTK+ 1.2 if 2.x is not
    found.  An optional text (readline) based UI can be built
    instead by supplying configure with the '--with-textui' flag.

* Implemented DSSI project directory handling.

* Changed activate() to new behavior.

* Fixed bug where changes to tuning control would only effect first
    playing voice.

* Made a number of error messages more informational.

* Added converted FB-01 patches.

20041101 0.5.7 first public release

* Moved Test Note frame to be visible when both Patches and
    Configuration tabs are selected.

* Changed  tuning slider to a spinbutton for greater accuracy.

* Made a slightly better default patch set.

20041029 0.5.7-alpha -- initial alpha release

* "don't put that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been!"
