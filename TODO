hexter To-Do list, in no particular order:
==========================================
* implement some sort of volume scaling: I say a synth outputting
    floating point ought to have a nominal maximum output of 0dBFS
    _per voice_, but anything outputting to fixed point needs to
    scale that back to 0dBFS or less _total_.  Right now, I think
    hexter does -18dBFS _per voice_.

* Clean up all "!FIX!"es (and "-FIX-"es).

* Optionally sort patch list alphabetically (Steve Harris).

* Switch to GTK+ v2.x? (Chris Cannam).

* implement amplitude modulation, LFOs, and mod source routing (mod
    wheel, breath controller, foot pedal).

* optimize so if a voice just being set up still has all the
    patch data for the current edit buffer, we skip loading it.

* Figure out the feedback scaling "fudge factor".  The current 0.18
    is close, but not right on.

* Finish pitch envelope time calculation stuff.

* Add a high-pass filter to the output, to block very low frequency
    output like the DX7 does.

* Implement de-clicking of stolen voices.

* Implement any remaining DSSI bells and whistles (project
    directory, ?).
